Title: UN condemns Syria after massacre of civilians
Publish Date: 2012-05-28
Content:
UN condemns Syria after massacre of civilians Emergency meeting of UN discusses response to attack that killed 34 children Syrian government " in the strongest possible terms " for heavy - weapon attacks on the town of Houla , where 108 people , and up While the carefully worded statement stopped short of blaming anyone for the " close - range attacks " that killed many of the victims , the Council condemned " the killing of civilians by shooting at close range and by severe physical abuse " . The statement said the " outrageous use of force " against civilians violated international law and government commitments to cease violence , including the use of heavy weapons . The Syrian government denies responsibility for the massacre . The Foreign Secretary , William Hague , was expected to ask Russia , Syria 's only remaining major foreign ally , to put pressure on the regime to stop the killings . Kofi Annan , the UN - Arab League envoy , was also due for talks in Damascus . Mr Hague said he was " absolutely sickened " by the recent deaths in Syria . " It is a familiar tactic of the Assad regime to blame others for what 's happening in their country to try to get out of responsibility for the scale of the destruction , " he said . The deaths " illuminate the type of tyranny that the people in Syria have been experiencing " . Mr Hague is due in Moscow today and is expected to urge the Russian Foreign Minister to take a much tougher stance over the human - rights abuses committed by the Assad regime .(2012-05-28) 
Russia and China have been the main opponents of stronger action against the Syrian government . " It is n't in the interests of Russia , it 's not in anyone 's interests , for Syria to descend into an even bloodier situation and into a full - scale civil war , and that 's now the danger , " Mr Hague said . Diplomats say Britain and France had proposed issuing a press statement condemning the killings , but Russia told Council members it could not agree and wanted to be briefed first by Major - General Robert Mood , who is heading the UN observer mission in Syria . Syria is once more facing diplomatic isolation . Mr Annan is due back in Damascus today for talks aimed at rescuing his foundering peace plan , which was agreed seven weeks ago .(2012-05-28) 
The Syrian government denies its forces were responsible for the killings at Houla . But it has not produced a credible alternative explanation of what happened there to cast doubt on the claims of the opposition , largely confirmed by UN - ceasefire monitors , that the slaughter of at least 34 children and their parents was carried out by pro - government forces . To survive , President Bashar al - Assad needs to avoid the international isolation which befell Libya . He also needs to prevent Syrians , and the world , from believing the fall of his regime is inevitable and they should avoid betting on a loser . " How will Russia respond to this ? " asked one foreign diplomat in Damascus yesterday .(2012-05-27) 
" That is the crucial question . " Russia remains Syria 's most important friend . It was Russian and Chinese vetoes at the UN Security Council in February that relieved Syria from the danger of foreign intervention similar to that which overthrew Colonel Muammar Gaddafi in Libya . But Russia is paying a price for backing Syria , and this price will have been raised by the Houla killings . It may not want to be allied to a regime in a permanent state of crisis . President Assad can look for longer - term support to Iran and , to a lesser extent , Iraq , both Shia powers . They see Syria as being targeted by the Sunni rulers of Saudi Arabia and Qatar . The Iranians have been giving some economic aid to reduce the impact of sanctions . Hezbollah in Lebanon will also be loath to see its long - term ally in Syria go down . But the Iranians , whose foreign policy is normally cautious and devious , will not want to depend on the survival of President Assad . They will look for an accommodation with any successor government , though Iran still faces a serious strategic defeat . It will be losing its one important ally in the Arab world . It will lose much of its ability to play a role as a regional power . The Syrian chargé d'affaires will be summoned to the Foreign Office today to hear Britain 's condemnation of the Houla massacre , which the Syrian government denies .(2012-05-28) 
Nick Clegg , the Deputy Prime Minister , said : " The scenes of savagery that we have seen on our television screens are revolting , stomach - churning . " Mr Clegg and Alistair Burt , the Foreign Office minister , warned that Syrian officials may not be allowed into London for the Olympics . Mowaffak Joumma , the chairman of the Syrian Olympic committee , last night said the Olympic charter forbade host nations from banning athletes .(2012-05-27) 
" Authority of any host country is limited to organising and offering all necessary facilities to all participating athletes , " he said .

Egypt president decrees pardon for protesters Home Egypt Egypt president decrees pardon for protesters In this image released by the Egyptian Presidency taken on Saturday , Oct. 6 , 2012 , Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi , waves to the crowd gathered in a stadium upon his arrival for a speech on the 6th of October national holiday marking the 1973 war with Israel in Cairo , Egypt .(2012-10-06) 
Morsi boasts of his achievements in his first 100 days in office but sidesteps the key issues in the political transition to democratic rule . ( AP Photo / Egyptian Presidency ) CAIRO ( AP ) — Egypt 's new president on Monday issued a decree pardoning all those charged with or convicted of acts " in support of the revolution " since the beginning of the popular uprising that forced his predecessor , Hosni Mubarak , from power .(2012-10-08) 
The move by Mohammed Morsi was long demanded by Egypt 's youth groups behind the uprising . It could potentially benefit more than 1,000 protesters currently on trial following their arrests during demonstrations since the uprising against Mubarak erupted on Jan. 25 , 2011 and until Morsi was sworn in on June 30 .(2011-01-25) 
Those already convicted for their role in the protests may also be pardoned . Most of those on trial or convicted were detained during the rule of the generals who took over after Mubarak stepped down in February 2011 . Mohammed Gadallah , Morsi 's legal advisor , said the decree is " one of the revolution 's most important victories . " " It shows the revolution is now in power and guides the decision - making , " Gadallah told The Associated Press . " This is a legislation that protects the revolutionaries . " However , the wording of the decree is vague and does n't immediately set anyone free , according to several human rights lawyers . It asks the prosecutor general and the military prosecutor to prepare a list of names , within a month of the decree 's issuance , of those who may benefit from the pardon . The first article of the decree , which was published on Morsi 's official Facebook page , orders a " comprehensive pardon for crimes and misdemeanors or attempts to commit them in support of the revolution and the realization of its goals . " The only suspects exempted from the decree are those charged with premeditated murder over that time period . " It is a great step , but not enough , " said Ahmed Seif , a member of the committee formed by Morsi to review cases of those tried following the uprising . He said he had advised Morsi to specify who would benefit from the pardon . " Now , there will be differences over how to implement the pardon , and a debate , " Seif said . Gadallah said the decree is likely to cover all major court cases where protesters clashed with military troops and security forces . However , he admitted it is not clear how many would benefit from the pardon . Another human rights lawyer , Ahmed Ragheb , praised Morsi 's decree but said it does n't include " all the victims of the past period . " Ragheb said Morsi 's choice of wording in the decree — " those supporting the revolution " — can be interpreted in different ways . " No one is facing charges called ' supporting the revolution , ' " Ragheb said . Protesters currently on trial face charges ranging from resisting authorities , damaging public or private property or disrupting public order . More than a 12,000 civilians have been brought before military tribunals , many of them on charges such as " thuggery . " It will be up to the prosecutor general and the military prosecutor to name those who will be pardoned . Suspects who are excluded can challenge the decision , and a judicial panel would be the final arbiter . A month after becoming president , Morsi pardoned more than 500 civilians convicted before military tribunals . But rights groups have criticized Morsi , and the military generals who ruled before him , for failing to bring to trial most of the policemen , army troops and officers suspected of using excessive force or torture against protesters . Mohammed Abdel - Aziz , a lawyer involved in many of the protesters ' cases , said the amnesty is too little too late and that the pardons should come with a financial compensation . Abdel - Aziz said the decree is likely meant to ease political pressure on Morsi just days ahead of a protest rally against the president planned for Friday .(2012-10-05)

Title: Bush plea tries to rebuild US image
Publish Date: 2005-01-04
Content:
President George W. Bush yesterday appoints two former presidents ,  George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton , to launch a joint appeal to the American people for emergency donations to victims of the Indian Ocean tsunami .(2005-01-03) 
They stood side by side in the White House 's Roosevelt Room as Mr Bush told reporters : " We 're here to ask our fellow citizens to join in a broad humanitarian relief effort . " In the coming days , Presidents Clinton and Bush will ask Americans to donate directly to reliable charities already providing help to tsunami victims . In this situation , cash donations are most useful , and I 've asked the former presidents to solicit contributions both large and small . I ask every American to contribute as they are able to do so . " According to the Wall Street Journal , Americans have so far given about $ 100 m ( £ 52.5 m ) to US - based charities . As the presidential appeal was launched , the US flag on the White House was lowered to half - mast , marking the start of a week of mourning . The three presidents were also due to visit the Indonesian , Sri Lankan , Indian and Thai embassies in Washington to offer their condolences . Mr Clinton and the presi dent 's father were expected to give a string of media interviews to publicise the appeal . The president 's brother , Jeb Bush , the governor of Florida , is already involved in the relief effort and is accompanying the secretary of state , Colin Powell , on a tour of the disaster zone . Mr Bush said they would brief him personally on their return . So far , the US administration has offered $ 350 m in humanitarian aid , but White House and congressional officials predicted that figure would rise . Since being criticised last week for being slow to respond to the disaster , the White House has moved to play a leading role in the relief efforts . US helicopters and planes have begun delivering emergency supplies to some of the most remote and badly - hit area , such as the west coast of Indonesia 's Aceh province . One airlift at a time , they have begun to rebuild America 's reputation particularly in Indonesia , the world 's most populous Muslim country , whose people overwhelmingly opposed the invasion of Iraq . Colonel Yani Basuki , a spokesman for the Indonesian government 's emergency relief mission , said America 's assistance was appreciated . " It has made a big difference , " he told the Guardian . " We do not have enough helicopters and so the American aircraft are enabling us to reach many more people ... than would otherwise have been the case . They are certainly saving lives . " The Seahawk helicopters are based on the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln , which arrived off the coast of Aceh on Saturday .(2005-01-01) 
The ship 's commander , Captain Kendall Card , said the Seahawks flew 27 missions yesterday , delivering 36 tonnes of aid .(2005-01-03) 
The Pentagon has also sent the USNS Mercy , a 1,000-bed hospital ship , to the region , to help treat victims and help prevent the outbreak of water - borne epidemics . One senior Jakarta - based Asian diplomat said such missions would " make a huge difference " to Indonesians ' view of the US government . " Washington has lost most Indonesians ' hearts and many of their minds , " he said . " Provided they play this right it stands to win back many friends it has lost over Iraq and Palestine . " Ken Conboy , a security analyst in Jakarta , agreed although he thought Washington would probably have reacted equally generously if Indonesia had not been a prominent Muslim country . " Having said that the US will be extra careful to make sure they get it right , " he told the Guardian . " They have a great opportunity here to win back some of the support they have lost . Even if it 's a by - product of what they would want to do anyway , they wo n't want to pass up the opportunity . " But he said it would be impossible to win over all the sceptics . " They could do backflips and they would n't be appreciated by some , " he said . European diplomats in Jakarta are also watching how Washington responds to the crisis . " It could be very good for the US , " one told the Guardian .

It 's exciting on another level . " Despite the contract being for only five months , Beckham said he expected to be involved with the club beyond the end of his playing career . " I do n't see that it 's a short - term contract . It might be a short - term project for me playing but there 's a lot happening at this club with these owners . I might have only signed until the end of the season but I consider myself to be part of the future of this club â€ “ in helping this club to grow and the French league to grow and to help this club become one of the biggest powerhouses in football . " The France coach , Didier Deschamps , said Beckham 's arrival would provide a welcome boost for the profile of Ligue 1 . " He 's a personality who goes beyond football , like Zlatan Ibrahimovic maybe . They are players who beyond our frontiers give an important visibility to Ligue 1 . " But I wo n't judge it on a sporting perspective . I 'm not the coach , general manager or owner of Paris Saint - Germain . They 've made their choice with David Beckham . He 's a world football personality . ".

President accepts full responsibility for invasion Pentagon to plant pro-US stories in global media President Bush conceded yesterday that much of the pre-war intelligence on Iraq `` turned out to be wrong '' but took sole responsibility for ordering the invasion , which he said was justified by the potential threat posed by Saddam Hussein .(2005-12-14) 
Mr Bush has acknowledged flaws in US intelligence on Iraq before , but this was his most wholehearted acknowledgment to date of the scale of the errors underlying his administration 's allegations over Saddam 's alleged weapons of mass destruction . `` It is true that much of the intelligence turned out to be wrong , '' he said . But he repeated the administration 's frequently made defense that other intelligence agencies had made similar mistakes , and Democratic politicians had voted for war based on the same intelligence the president had seen . However , Mr Bush acknowledged that the final decision to invade had been his alone . `` As president , I am responsible for the decision to go into Iraq , '' he said . It was revealed yesterday , on the eve of elections in Iraq , that the Pentagon had set up a $ 300m -LRB- # 170m -RRB- psychological warfare operation that involves placing pro-American messages in foreign media outlets across the world , including those of its allies , without disclosing the US government as the source .(2005-12-14) 
One of the military officials in charge of the program told USA Today the campaign was designed to counter terrorist ideology and sway foreign audiences to support American policies .(2005-12-15) 
It will target newspapers , websites , radio and television . The revelations come amid the growing controversy over the US military 's covert operations to plant `` good news '' in the Iraqi media by paying newspapers to run stories . Military officials involved with the latest Pentagon campaign said they did not plan to place false stories in foreign news outlets clandestinely . But Mike Furlong , the deputy director of the joint psychological operations support element , told the newspaper that the military would not always reveal its role in distributing pro-American messages . `` While the product may not carry the label ` Made in the USA ' , we will respond truthfully if asked -LRB- by journalists -RRB- , '' he said . The Pentagon was also under scrutiny yesterday for its activities inside the US following claims that it has a secret database on those who oppose the Iraq war and may also be monitoring peace demonstrations .(2005-12-14) 
The database , obtained by the NBC television network , lists 1,500 `` suspicious incidents '' across the US over a 10-month period and includes four dozen anti-war meetings or protests , some aimed at military recruiting , The monitoring of anti-war activities has been treated with suspicion by Americans since the Vietnam era when it emerged the Pentagon spied on anti-war and civil rights campaigners . The White House and Pentagon refused to comment on the Pentagon 's plans to place pro-American stories in foreign media outlets . It is legal for the government to plant propaganda in other countries but not in the US . According to USA Today , special operations command awarded three five-year contracts in June for contractors to develop slogans , advertisements , newspaper articles , radio spots and television programs overseas to build support for US policies .(2005-12-15) 
Among the companies to have been awarded a contract is the Lincoln Group , a firm set up in Washington two years ago and run by a Briton , Christian Bailey . Military chiefs are currently investigating the program and the reported payment of Iraqi journalists and newspapers to run pro-American stories .
